    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This creamy tomato soup is delicious and has a twist - the addition of
      strong, black coffee. This is the perfect summer dish for using freshly
      picked tomatoes from the garden. Remember - the better the quality of the
      tomatoes, the better the taste of the soup.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped carrots</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>¾ cup strong brewed coffee</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion,
        carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has
        softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes,
        tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to
        a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than
        halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen
        towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
        the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until
        smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm.
        Do not boil.
      </li>
    </ol>
