    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored
      foods in Korean cuisine. Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a popular meal
      consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and
      gochujang (red chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or
      Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who cannot handle the spiciness,
      <em>like our children.</em>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir
        in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain
        spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside
        in a bowl and stir in soy sauce..
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir
        carrots until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just
        until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with
        red pepper flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes
        per side; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over
        medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but
        whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture,
        a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each
        serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of
        sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.
